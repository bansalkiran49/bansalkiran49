Hello, my name is Kiran, and I am a transitioning professional looking to start a career in data science. I have recently completed a comprehensive data science program from INSAID to learn the necessary skills and techniques for data analysis and machine learning.
- Prior to this, I pursued a career in optometry and worked as an optometrist for several years. Although I enjoyed helping patients with their vision, I always had a strong interest in analyzing data and using it to drive decision-making.
- I have hands-on experience with programming language such as Python and its Library. I have completed several data science projects that involved data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, Predictive modelling and data visualization.
- My experience in optometry has given me valuable skills such as attention to detail, critical thinking, and the ability to communicate complex ideas in simple terms. I am now eager to apply these skills to the field of data science and contribute to solving real-world problems.
- In my free time, I enjoy reading about new developments in data science and participating in online communities to enhance my knowledge and skills. I am a quick learner, a team player, and I believe in continuous learning and improvement.
- Please feel free to reach out to me at bansalkiran49@gmail.com to discuss any opportunities or collaborations. Thank you for taking the time to read my profile!
